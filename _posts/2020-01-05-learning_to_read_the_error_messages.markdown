My biggest Problem at first with coding is..............! Those error messages. For the life of me I really dislike them for the simple fact they were sometimes confusing to me because I was just learning how to code. I remember asking the cohort lead questions about how to know what exactly they mean. "(given2,  expected 0)", "Undefined method error" and so on. After getting a vague understanding of them I kept moving forward and reached out to google to get a much better understanding and then as time went on I guess some of those messages started to make sense. I am an infant in the coding arena but a warrior none the less. So each time I saw an error message that I had seen before I would write down the code I put in and if it changed the error message I knew I had done something right. I would then compile all of the code I had written down and I would read over the lines of code all at once to gain a much better understanding of what was going on. I know it's the long way of getting it done but at this point I am a rookie and those are some of the mistakes or making something simple difficult things I will do along my coding journey.
