 I am a newby when it comes to coding and I have been trying to learn how to code and it seemed exciting at first, but now I wish I could "Choke Slam" Ruby! The ask a question feature on learn.co.....I can't be the only one who gets pissed off by being asked questions on something I reached out to you to help me understand. I guess not giving us the answers is the best way to learn....I think. I was under the impression that we were gonna be taught and then tested on what we were lectured on like in grammar school. I understand what methods, arrays, hashes, classes, and operators are....but how and when to use them explicitly or implicitly and any other coding language way of explaining it I still struggle with it. The instructors and coaches and anybody else whom I have interacted with have said time and time again it is part of the when learning how to code. You are learning another language and there is gonna be frustration but if you can muscle thru it on the other side you will see it was all worth it. Coding is kind of one those things that you get the easy stuff first and you are so excited about what you've learned and then you get hit with "WTF" ![](http://<div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="4669714" data-share-method="host" data-width="100%" data-aspect-ratio="1.4678899082568808"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/cube-ice-gif-4669714">Ice Cube GIF</a> from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/cube-gifs">Cube GIFs</a></div><script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>) . I have realized that I can't quit now because i have come so far that it makes no sense to let all that i have learned in the time i have spent learning it all go to waste. I am thankful for my cohort especially because without them I would not have made it this far. So shout out to the 8/12 crew. I hope in reading this that folks don't get discouraged about learning how to code I just don't want to give a false since of reality when in fact learning how to code has it's rewards but they won't always come easy.
