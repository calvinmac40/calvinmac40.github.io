This was a "BIG DEAL" for me mainly because before a few months ago, if someone said code, bash, cli, instantiate I would've given them the Duh face and the classic I understand nod. I mean the word "Terminal" I would have thought you were talking about something at an airport or "Class" some form of grade school and "Method"....Method Man...you knew that was coming! Thanks to me being determined to learn how to code and using my wife and kids as motivation to not quit I have reached this milestone that others haven't. Coding is not for everyone and I truly understand why. You are learning another language from scratch. This project has shown me that I potential to create something powerful. I mean this isn't the next Facebook, Twitter, and the likes but it's a start. I can see how coding has the potential to create very pwerful programs that can do good or bad things. The idea of this project came from me being a music lover ofcourse and have ohter music lovers find information about some of there favorite artists. Like I said before this is just the start keep an eye out for this old guy I just might shock you!
