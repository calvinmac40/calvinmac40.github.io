<p>I am a native of Washington DC born and raised in the DMV(Google the term if interested). We as a family moved between Maryland and DC, most of which was spent in the district. I graduated from Anacostia Shs. I immediately went in to the military after graduation. spent a tour of duty in Anchorage, AK. After my very short military career I came home and got in to armed security field and have had a lot of great experiences during my time in this field but I have increasingly as of late been feeling like there is something  more rewarding out there for me. So one day I was scrolling down my timeline on Instagram and came across an advertisement "Do you want to learn how to code"? I clicked on it and started doing the challenges that were asked of me which developing habits of a software engineer. I also while doing the challenges started reading some articles on coding and came across a couple articles one of which stated that coding was a part of everyday life. The details of that statement really got my attention! I started to google more on what exactly was coding and how is it actually  a part of everyday life. Fast forward to today I am currently enrolled in Flatiron school.</p>
